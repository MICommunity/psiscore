# Introduction #

We provide a reference implementation that allows you to access PSISCORE servers in an easy fashion. You have two options of obtaining the reference implementation:
  1. the packaged jar file that contains all classes of the reference implementation, but not the required librarires
  1. the source code and the Maven pom file that allows you to build your own PSISCORE client from scratch.

More text on how to use the reference client is coming. So long, have a look at the PsiscoreClientExample.java that you can find in the source code. This file is rather self-explanatory and should show you, how to communicate with PSISCORE servers.
