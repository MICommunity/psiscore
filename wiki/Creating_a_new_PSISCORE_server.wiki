=PSISCORE web service reference implementation=
The source code of the PSISCORE web service reference implementation can be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/psiscore/downloads/list download section] of the PSISCORE project site. PSISCORE relies on [http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven] for managing Java dependencies and project settings. Therefore, all you need to do in order to build your own PSISCORE server from the source code provided is to start the Maven build process. If you do not have a local installation of Maven, you can get the software and extensive documentation on how to install it on the [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven homepage].

==Building a new PSISCORE service==
Once you installed Maven, you can start compiling your own PSISCORE server. The source code of the reference implementation contains a {{{pom.xml}}} file with Maven specific instructions. You can start the build process by issuing the following command in the directory where the {{{pom.xml}}} file is located:

{{{mvn clean install}}}

Maven will then download all the Java libraries required by the PSISCORE reference implementation, compile the source code, and package it into a web archive (war) file. 

==Testing the PSISCORE service==
Once the Maven build process has finished, you can deploy the web archive into a dedicated server like [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat] or [http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/ Jetty]. 

===Apache Tomcat===
After placing the war file into the {{{webapps}}} folder of your Apache Tomcat installation (see the documentation at  [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat] for instructions on how to obtain a server installation), you can start the server and access its test page in your local browser (without changes to its configuration, the URL will be "http://localhost:8080/" or "http://localhost:8180/" followed by the PSISCORE directory name with the webapps directory, for instance "psiscore-ws/". If everything went well, you will see a test page that will contain the web service description of your PSISCORE service. 

===Jetty===
An even easier way, especially for testing your PSISCORE service, is to use the [http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/ Jetty] server that is already configured in the PSISCORE Maven configuration file. To start Jetty right after the build process has finished, you need to add {{{jetty:run}}} to the build command described above:

{{{mvn clean install jetty:run}}}

If you then go to your browser (same comments to the URL as above), you can again see the aforementioned test page and the web service description of your PSISCORE service.
