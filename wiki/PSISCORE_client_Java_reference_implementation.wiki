#summary Java reference implementation to access PSISCORE servers
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

We provide a reference implementation that allows you to access PSISCORE servers in an easy fashion. You have two options of obtaining the reference implementation:
  # the packaged jar file that contains all classes of the reference implementation, but not the required librarires
  # the source code and the Maven pom file that allows you to build your own PSISCORE client from scratch.
