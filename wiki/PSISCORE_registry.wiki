#summary Registry of available PSISCORE servers
#labels Phase-Deploy,Phase-Support

= Introduction =
The PSISCORE registry maintains a list of all available scoring servers and the scoring routines they provide. This enables new PSISCORE server providers to make their service available to all client users simply by registering it with the registry.  

Currently, a powerful registry similar to the [http://www.dasregistry.org/ DAS registry] or the [http://code.google.com/p/psicquic/wiki/Registry PSICQUIC registry] is being developed. As long as this service is not publicaly available, the list of servers will be manually maintained.
