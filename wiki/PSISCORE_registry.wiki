= Introduction =

The PSISCORE registry maintains a list of all available scoring servers. This enables new PSISCORE server providers to make their service available to all client user simply by registering it with the registry. 

Currently, a registry similar to the [http://code.google.com/p/psicquic/wiki/Registry PSICQUIC registry] is being developed. As long as this service is not available, the list of servers will be manually maintained. In order to add a new scoring server, PSISCORE service providers only need to contact and we will update the registry instantly.
