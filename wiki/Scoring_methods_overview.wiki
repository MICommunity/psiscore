#summary Overview of scoring methods that have been introduced

Here we try to provide an overview of the confidence scoring methods that are known to us. As confidence scoring of interactions is a very diverse field (and many methods that can be used to assess the reliability of an interaction have not actually been developed for this purpose) the list below is not intended to be comprehensive. However, if you know a method that is not included in our list, please contact us or add a reference or a link in the comment to this page.

= Scoring methods = 

The following scoring methods are known to us. The ordering is arbitrary. 

== MINT score ==
The MINT score takes into account experimental evidence associated with the interaction detection method.

Range: 0-1

==MI score==
The MI score is calculated based on the number of publications, the experimental detection methods and the interaction types that support a certain interaction.

Range: 0-1

==Braun et al.==
Braun et al. propose an experimentally derived confidence score for binary protein interactions.

==iRefIndex scores==
[http://irefindex.uio.no/wiki/iRefIndex iRefIndex] calculates three scores that are based on the publications (and their PubMed identifiers) that report an interaction. 

*lpr score (lowest pmid re-use)* describes the lowest number of distinct interactions that any one PMID supporting the interaction is used to support. A value of one indicates that at least one of the PMIDs supporting this interaction has never been used to support any other interaction. This likely indicates that only one interaction was described by that reference and that the present interaction is not derived from high throughput methods.
Range: 0-inf

*hpr score (highest pmid re-use)* is the highest number of interactions that any one PMID  supporting the interaction in this row is used to support. High values indicate that a publication describes many other interactions as well, which is likely the case for high-throughput methods.
Range: 0-inf

*np score (number pmids)* is the total number of unique PMIDs used to support the interaction. 
Range: 0-inf
